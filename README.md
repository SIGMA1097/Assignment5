Preliminary Analysis
The Hitters Cleaned dataset is a ‘mixed dataset’ containing continuous and categorical data set. In this dataset there are various independent variables like AtBat, Hits, HmRuns, Runs, RBI, Walks, Years, CatBat, Chits, CHmRun, Cruns, CRBI, Cwalks, League, Division, Putouts, Assists, Errors and a single dependant variable Salary.

## Pre-Requisites
As a pre-requisite we need python, jupyter notebook for coding and git hub to host this project.
This project requires the dataset named Hitters-Cleaned.csv 

A Python file (code) named "Hitters-Cleaned" is uploaded

### Installing
Following python libraries was imported before starting the project.
Pandas
numpy
matplotlib
The libraries are loaded into python

Description about loaded libraries
"pandas" are used to analyze data
matplotlib library in python serves as a visualization utility

#### STEP-4
Dataset is loaded into the python
Excel file is imported into Python using Pandas, read_excel is used
Dataset contains various independent variables like AtBat, Hits, HmRuns, Runs, RBI, Walks, Years, CatBat, Chits, CHmRun, Cruns, CRBI, Cwalks, League, Division, Putouts, Assists, Errors and a single dependant variable Salary.

##### STEP-5
KEY STATISTICS is decribed
The key statistics such as 'count','mean'(average),'std'(standard deviation),'min'(minimum value),'25%','50%','75%'(percentiles) and 'max'(maximum value) is described.
