##  STEP-2
A Python file (code) named "Hitters-Cleaned" is uploaded

### STEP-3
The libraries are loaded into python

Description about loaded libraries
"pandas" are used to analyze data
matplotlib library in python serves as a visualization utility

#### STEP-4
Dataset is loaded into the python
Excel file is imported into Python using Pandas, read_excel is used
Dataset contains various independent variables like AtBat, Hits, HmRuns, Runs, RBI, Walks, Years, CatBat, Chits, CHmRun, Cruns, CRBI, Cwalks, League, Division, Putouts, Assists, Errors and a single dependant variable Salary.

##### STEP-5
KEY STATISTICS is decribed
The key statistics such as 'count','mean'(average),'std'(standard deviation),'min'(minimum value),'25%','50%','75%'(percentiles) and 'max'(maximum value) is described.
